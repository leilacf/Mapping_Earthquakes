# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project was to utilize JavaScript and Leaflet to create an interactive earthquake map. Please note that the final documents have been uploaded in the Earthquake_Challenge directory. To run an API key from Mapbox is needed, which was not included above as a general safe practice. 

#### Overview 
This interactive map highlights earthquake activity occuring globally, providing a perspicacious data visual which can help inform users on the impact of natural disasters happening as close as in their own land to as far as other continents. 

The map contains:
- three map styles (Street view, Satellite view, and Dark view)
- three filtering options (Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes)
- Zoom ability in left hand corner
- Legend on the bottom right hand corner detailing the magnitude of the earthquake

Additionally, the earthquake markers tell a story themselves--their diameter and color demonstrate the intensity of the seismic waves. When one clicks on the markers, a popup text appears showing location and magnitude information.

#### Process
To create this interactive map, the following tools were used:
